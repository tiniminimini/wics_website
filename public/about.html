				<h2>What is WiCS?</h2>
				<div class="box_right"><p><img width="100%" src="events/citizenSchools/sarah.jpg"></img></p></div>
				<p>
				  Women in Computer Science (WiCS) is an organization dedicated to encouraging and supporting women in Computer Science and related fields.  We hold weekly general body meetings, engage in community outreach, and occasionally hold professional events.

				<h2>Why does WiCS exist?</h2>

				<h3>In other words, the percentage of women in CS at WPI has remained stagnant <i>the last four years!</i></h3>
				<h2>Why is this the case?</h2>
				<p>There are a number of reasons women do not become or remain CS majors:
					<li>Feelings of intimidation due to the small number of women (especially compared to other majors)</li>
					<li>Feelings of isolation</li>
					<li>Sexism from their male peers</li>
					<li>Lack of experience, especially compared to many of their male peers</li>
					<li>Imposter syndrome, which can be caused by any or all of the above points</li>
				</p>
				<h2>So where does WiCS fit in?</h2>
				<p>
					We believe that creating a supportive and encouraging community for women is vital to getting them interested in computer science and related fields (and keeping them there). As part of this mission, we invite women to join our organization to feel less alone in a field that is predominantly male. We are a group of women who understand what you are going through, because we are dealing with this reality in real time, every step of the way.
