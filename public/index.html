				<h2>Welcome to WiCS!</h2>
				<p>
					We are a club that promotes and encourages women in the field of computer science. We represent
					women who already have an interest in CS, and we want to encourage others to share in that interest
					as well. We meet once a week to talk about current issues, interests, and just have some fun. 
					We have fun events throughout the year, some which are listed below. For more information, 
					see our <a href="events.html">events</a> page of past events
					or visit our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wpiwics">facebook</a> page.

				<h3>Nail Polish Party</h3>
				<div id="box_left" >
				WiCS hosted its third, bi-annual Nail Polish Party last D Term - a way for women all over WPI to get 
				together and paint each others nails, play games and relax before finals!
				This year, WiCS will be hosting two more Nail Polish Parties, one in A Term and D term. 
				Be on the look out for locations this year!</div>
