				<h3>Speaker - Lynn Andrea Stein</h3>
				<p>
					Tuesday, April 15 at 7pm in FLAUD<br>
					Presented by WPI ACM and WiCS
					<div class="box_left"><img width="100%" src="events/steinD08/stein.png"></img></div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Von Neumann serial computation has been our field's central metaphor. It has even influenced 
					how we think brains work.  But the sequentialist metaphor isn't right for brains.  
					It isn't even right for what computers do. Instead, computation arises over a community 
					of interacting entities.<br>
					When we shift our fundamental metaphor, it changes the way we think about computation.  
					It changes what we teach our students.  And it changes the ways in which we think about thinking itself.
				</p>

				<h3>Outreach - Bootstrap Programming</h3>
				<div class="box_left"><img width="100%" src="events/citizenSchools/logo.gif"></img></div>
				<div class="box_right"><img width="100%" src="events/citizenSchools/love.jpg"></img></div>
				<p>WiCS members members taught video game programing to local middle schoolers in a nine-week after school program run by <a href="http://www.citizenschools.org/"> Citizen Schools.</a>
				  We hoped inspire the students to explore technolgy on their own and to set a strong positive female role model of women in computer science.
				</p>

				<h3>Networking - Google</h3>
				<div class="box_right"><img width="100%" src="events/googleA05/google-1.jpg"></img></div>
				<p>
					This was one of WiCS's first professional & networking events.  
					Engineers from Google came to share some of their knowledge (and T-Shirts!) with WiCS members over snacks.
