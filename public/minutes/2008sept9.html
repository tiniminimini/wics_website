<h2> Bootstraping Meeting</h2>
 <p>

     <li>Treasurer: Antonyia Statelova
     <li>Secretary: Manasi Vartak
     <li>Lounge Manager: Catlin Vandyke
     <li>Outreach Coordinator: Sarah Judd
     <li>Events: Kara Greenfield
   </ul>

   <b>Announcements</b><br>
   <ul>
     <li>Sarah: Teaching robotics to local middle schoolers.  If you want to help, drop her an email.</li>
     <li>Manasi: Going to Grace Hooper Conference!</li>
     <li>Galia: SGA gave us $295 for the year.</li>
   </ul>

   <b>What we are doing this year</b><br>
   <ul>
     <li>Lounge Redecorating Party: Spruce up the lounge.  Ideas Welcome.  Deocrate with XKCD comics?  Yes!</li>
     <li>Weekly WiCS Mixer: Regular time where people meet in the lounge to hang out and eat snacks.  The main goal of which would be to foster bonding and give people a place to feel like they belong in the cs building.</li>
     <li>Mentor Program: Assigning specific mentors has failed in the past. New program will be more informal. We will either assign freshmen to a pool of WiCS mentors or having a set time(s) where freshmen and upperclassmen could meet and upperclassmen could share advice.</li>
     <li>Bagels:  We are no longer selling bagels.</li>
     <li>CS WIN: Like the Women in Industry Network only without a Chem Eng making a speech for 1.5 hours and with more CS people</li>
   </ul>

   <b>Individual Tasks</b><br>
   <ul>
     <li>Sarah: Talk to Katy about Worcester groups who would love to be reached out to.</li>
     <li>Galia: Fill out officer change form</li>
     <li>Kara and Catlin: Arrange Lounge Redecorating Party</li>
     <li>Leena: Find out what in the office we can get rid of and where it should go.  </li>
     <li>Manasi: Figure out a time we can all meet each week.  During the school day preferable because professors can come.</li>
     <li>Galia: Talk to Jesse about hooking up a computer that we can log into</li>
     <li>Leena: Send out SGA OCFC presentation</li>
