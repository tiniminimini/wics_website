Discussion about WICS becoming an official WPI org:<p>
- Student activities office says in order to get funding,
  can have graduate student members, but officers must
  be undergraduates.<p>

  not for undergrad<p>
- Maybe have 2 "official" organizations (1 grad, 1 ug)
  for funding purposes, but we all meet together?<p>
- Must be an organization for at least a year before
  we can get funded, so this won't be an issue right away<BR>
