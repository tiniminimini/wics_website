I think the Pizza Event was a success, and I'm sorry we ran out of pizza 
before 1:00!
<p>
Two things:
<p>
1. We need an agenda for the next meeting. Please email your items and I 
will collect them. One item I suggest is:
<p>
Election of officers (and then like the Iraquis, these officers with the 
rest of our help can help push through the constitution)
<p>
2. We need a time for the next meeting. I'd like to suggest Friday
2/25 at 4 (with ice cream?).
