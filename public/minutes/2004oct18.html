We had the second meeting of Wics today.  We developed a constitution 
which is attached.  Please review it and send any comments to the 
wics@wpi.edu mailing list.
<p>
This brings me to the next point, as we have now created a wics@wpi.edu 
mailing list, emails will now be sent to that.  If you would like to 
participate in the organization, please feel free to sign up to the alias.
 No more emails regarding Wics will be sent to this massive list of 
people.
<p>
Our next meeting with be Monday 11/22 at noon.  Feel free to bring a bag 
lunch, or perhaps we can arrange for food (although we would all need to 
then pay some money).  We determined today that rotating day/time meetings 
would be best, (weekly at first, but eventually once every other week). 
So the schedule of meetings is as follows
<p>
Thurs., 12/2, 4pm<BR>
     Fri., 12/9, noon<BR>
     Tues., 12/13, 1pm<BR>
