<p>General Meeting September 6, 2006</p>

<ul>

  <li>Google Event is on September 22<sup>nd</sup>. &nbsp;Colloquium at 11 
and sit-down in the Mid-Century Room 
  from 2-4. &nbsp;All are invited (meaning the whole campus).

  <li>We are planning to have a panel of 
  alums on December 5<sup>th</sup>. &nbsp;Since it will consist of working 
  women, we were thinking about having them come around 6 . 6:30 and 
getting 
  them some pizzas and then at 7 we could hold the panel. &nbsp;Karen is 
going 
  to look into getting a room in the CC (Hopefully the Mid-Century room) 
for 
  this. &nbsp;More to follow.&nbsp; 

  <li>Kerri is holding a CS1101 study 
  session on Thursday.&nbsp; E-mail sent out to the class mailing list to 
  advertise.
  
  <li>We signed the Anti-Hazing form and 
  went over what was in the contract.
  
  <li>Bagels are going well.&nbsp; We 
  will continue to do a mix of bagels and muffins.
 
  <li>Tried to come up with ideas for 
  events to help up membership

  <ol>

    <li>Dinner at DAKA . Kerri will send 
    out e-mail to mailing list to ask what time people go to 
    dinner
