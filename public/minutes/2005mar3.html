Dear WICS,
<p>
As some of you might already know, I was elected to the position of 
Treasurer for WICS at our last meeting.
In order to become an "official" WPI organization, we need to prepare some 
administrative paperwork, including a proposed budget.
<p>
So far I have the following items to consider in the proposal:
- refreshments for meetings
- travel expenses for guest speakers
- office supplies
<p>
Obviously, these items are pretty "high level" and need to be broken down 
to make them more explicit.  So I'm requesting any suggestions you have of 
either details on the above, or other items I should consider for a 
proposed budget.
<p>
Please send your suggestions to me: dkramer@cs.wpi.edu.
<p>
Thanks for your input!   -Diane Kramer
